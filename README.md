A series of coding experiments exploring GameMaker Studio 2 feature "Use Physics" that you can learn from and use as guides.

#why

Many a time I find myself asking "How do I tie a rope around a guy and tie that rope to a boulder" in GameMaker and this is the answer.  

There will be other examples when I need them.  Feel free to learn from and reuse this example.

If you really are thankful and it helps you a lot, and you release a game, why not place LostAstronaut.com in your credits as a way to say "Thanks, You're alright"
